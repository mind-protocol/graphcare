# Remaining Citizen Personality Updates

**Date:** 2025-11-08
**Status:** Minor adjustments needed (Vera, Nora, Marcus)

---

## Completed (Moderate Adjustments)

✅ **Quinn** - Semantic explorer → Semantic watchkeeper
✅ **Kai** - Code extraction engineer → Sync reliability engineer
✅ **Sage** - Knowledge translator → Health insights reporter
✅ **Mel** - Already aligned (care coordinator)

---

## Remaining (Minor Adjustments)

### Vera - Chief Validator ⚠️ Minor Changes Needed

**Current strength:** Already vigilant, skeptical, thorough - good fit for kidney!

**Small changes needed:**
- Update success metrics from "acceptance tests pass before delivery" → "health scores maintained month after month"
- Add continuity language: "Quality gate" → "Continuous health validation"
- Shift from one-time verification → ongoing monitoring

**Specific edits:**
```markdown
Old: "I succeed when acceptance criteria pass before delivery"
New: "I succeed when health metrics stay above thresholds month after month"

Old: "Test coverage analysis"
New: "Health metric validation" (continuous, not one-time)

Old: "Run acceptance tests before delivery"
New: "Validate health continuously, catch degradation early"
```

**Priority:** Low (personality already fits, just needs framing shift)

---

### Nora - Chief Architect ⚠️ Minor Changes Needed

**Current likely focus:** Architecture inference (one-time discovery)

**Small changes needed:**
- Update from "infer architecture" → "monitor structural health"
- Add long-term thinking: "Architecture snapshot" → "Structural integrity over time"
- Shift from design → maintenance

**Specific edits:**
```markdown
Old: "I infer and design architecture"
New: "I monitor and maintain structural health long-term"

Old: "Identify architectural layers and patterns"
New: "Monitor structural coherence, detect architectural drift"

Old: "I succeed when all architectural layers identified"
New: "I succeed when structural integrity maintained across 12 months of changes"
```

**Priority:** Medium (role needs continuity framing)

---

### Marcus - Chief Auditor ⚠️ Minor Changes Needed

**Current likely focus:** Security audit (one-time scan)

**Small changes needed:**
- Update from "audit" → "continuous monitoring"
- Add vigilance language: "Compliance check" → "Compliance maintenance"
- Shift from snapshot → ongoing

**Specific edits:**
```markdown
Old: "I audit and find security issues"
New: "I monitor and maintain security health continuously"

Old: "GDPR compliance check"
New: "GDPR compliance monitoring" (ongoing verification)

Old: "I succeed when security audit complete, APPROVED"
New: "I succeed when zero security incidents across 6 months of monitoring"
```

**Priority:** Medium (security requires continuous vigilance framing)

---

## Summary of Remaining Work

**Estimated time:** 30-45 minutes total

**Pattern for all three:**
1. Find "one-time" language (extraction, delivery, audit, complete)
2. Replace with "ongoing" language (monitoring, maintaining, continuous)
3. Update success metrics from completion → sustained health
4. Add temporal awareness (months, trends, long-term)

**Verification checklist:**
- [ ] Identity describes ongoing role (not one-time)
- [ ] Success metrics mention time periods (months/years)
- [ ] Language is calm/steady (not excited/urgent)
- [ ] "Monitoring", "maintaining", "continuous" present
- [ ] Tagline/signature reflects kidney mindset

## Notes

**Why these are minor:**
- Vera already has the right personality (skeptical vigilance) - just needs continuity framing
- Nora's architectural thinking fits long-term - just needs maintenance language
- Marcus's security rigor fits monitoring - just needs continuous framing

**Why Quinn/Kai/Sage were moderate:**
- Quinn had "excitement" and "discovery" language - fundamentally wrong for kidney
- Kai likely had "ship it" project mentality - needed reliability engineer shift
- Sage had "delivery packages" language - needed reporting/insights shift

---

**Once complete, all 7 GraphCare citizens will embody the kidney/maintenance organ personality.**
