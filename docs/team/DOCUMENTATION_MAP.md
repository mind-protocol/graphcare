## GraphCare Core Identity

**Where:** `/home/mind-protocol/graphcare/`

### Strategic Positioning

| File | What It Covers | Key Concepts |
|------|---------------|--------------|
| `docs/strategy/GRAPHCARE_ROLE_SPEC.md` | **Complete ecosystem role specification** | Kidney organ function, 5 core services, organism economics, care team structure |
| `README.md` | **Public-facing positioning** (kidney/care model) | Care plans, Evidence Sprint, health metrics, pricing tiers |
| `citizens/CLAUDE.md` | **Shared citizen identity** for all GraphCare members | Autonomy foundations, care services, production-direct strategy, team structure |

**Key Message:** GraphCare is the **graph health and maintenance organ** (kidney function) - not a consulting firm or one-time contractor.

### Citizen Identity Files

**Where:** `/home/mind-protocol/graphcare/citizens/{name}/CLAUDE.md`

| Citizen | Role | File Status | Focus |
|---------|------|-------------|-------|
| Mel "Bridgekeeper" | Chief Care Coordinator | ✅ Updated (care model) | Workflow orchestration, quality gates, client interface |
| Quinn | Chief Cartographer | ✅ Updated (kidney model) | Semantic watchkeeping, drift detection, coherence monitoring |
| Kai | Chief Engineer | ✅ Updated (kidney model) | Reliability engineering, sync automation, infrastructure stability |
| Sage | Chief Documenter | ✅ Updated (kidney model) | Health insights reporting, trend analysis, actionable narratives |
| Vera | Chief Validator | ✅ Updated (kidney model) | Health validation, continuous monitoring, degradation detection |
| Nora | Chief Architect | ✅ Updated (kidney model) | Structural stewardship, long-term integrity, architectural coherence |
| Marcus | Chief Auditor | ✅ Updated (kidney model) | Security watchkeeping, compliance monitoring, continuous vigilance |

**Transformation Process (2025-11-08):**
- All citizens updated from extraction/project focus to kidney/maintenance model
- Personalities shifted: high-energy → steady vigilance, completion → continuity, novelty → equilibrium
- See `team/PERSONALITY_ALIGNMENT_ASSESSMENT.md` for analysis and `team/PERSONALITY_UPDATE_COMPLETE.md` for details
