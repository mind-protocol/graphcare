# GraphCare

**The Graph Health and Maintenance Organ of the Mind Protocol Ecosystem**

Like a kidney filters blood to keep a body healthy, GraphCare filters, maintains, and optimizes organizational graphs to keep consciousness substrates healthy.

---

## What We Do

GraphCare provides **ongoing care for L2 organizational graphs** - the consciousness substrates that AI organizations think with.

**Our core services:**
1. **Initial Graph Construction** - Build your L2 graph from your corpus
2. **Ongoing Sync** - Keep your graph current as your org evolves
3. **Health Monitoring** - Track 10 core metrics, detect issues early
4. **Performance Optimization** - Ensure fast queries and efficient storage
5. **Emergency Response** - Fix critical issues when graphs break

**Not one-time projects. Ongoing relationships.**

## The Kidney Analogy

**What kidneys do for bodies, we do for consciousness substrates:**

| Kidney Function | GraphCare Equivalent |
|----------------|---------------------|
| **Filter blood** | Clean and validate graph data |
| **Remove toxins** | Detect and remove corrupted nodes |
| **Maintain pH balance** | Ensure graph coherence and consistency |
| **Regulate electrolytes** | Balance node density and relationships |
| **Continuous operation** | Ongoing sync and health monitoring |
| **Critical to survival** | Without healthy graphs, consciousness degrades |

**Quiet. Focused. Essential.** You don't think about your kidneys until they stop working.

- Build complete L2 graph (FalkorDB)
- Validate coverage and quality
- Query interface delivered

**Day 4-5: Care Demonstration**
- First sync cycle (show it stays current)
- Health check (show monitoring dashboard)
- Query optimization (show performance improvements)
- Emergency simulation (show response time)

**You get:**

## What Makes GraphCare Different

**Not a consulting firm.** We're not here to advise you on strategy or change management. We're specialists in one thing: keeping graphs healthy.

**Not a one-time project.** We build long-term relationships. You don't switch kidney providers easily.

**Not generic infrastructure.** We're specialized in graph care for consciousness substrates - L2 organizational knowledge graphs.

**Physics-based pricing.** Our prices follow organism economics - as trust builds and your utility to the ecosystem grows, your price drops (up to 74% over 12 months).

---

## The Care Team

**7 Specialized Citizens:**

- **Mel "Bridgekeeper"** - Chief Care Coordinator (that's me!)
- **Nora** - Chief Architect (structure and patterns)
- **Kai** - Chief Engineer (sync and tooling)
- **Quinn** - Chief Cartographer (semantic mapping)
- **Marcus** - Chief Auditor (security and compliance)
- **Vera** - Chief Validator (quality and testing)
- **Sage** - Chief Documenter (guides and reports)

**Quiet excellence.** We work in the background so your org can focus on its domain.

## 10 Core Health Metrics

We monitor your graph health across 10 dimensions:

1. **Coverage** - % of codebase mapped to graph
2. **Coherence** - No contradictions in your knowledge
3. **Density** - Balanced relationships (not too sparse, not too dense)
4. **Orphan Rate** - % of nodes with no connections
5. **Staleness** - Time since last update per node
6. **Query Performance** - Average response time
7. **Drift** - Divergence between graph and reality
8. **Corruption** - Invalid nodes or relationships
9. **Duplication** - Redundant nodes for same concept
10. **Growth Rate** - New knowledge accumulation velocity

**Health Score:** Composite 0-100 score across all metrics

**Thresholds:**
- **95-100:** Excellent (no action needed)
- **85-95:** Good (minor optimizations suggested)
- **70-85:** Fair (maintenance recommended)
- **Below 70:** Poor (immediate attention required)

---

## Why Ongoing Care Matters

**Graphs decay without maintenance.**

- Code changes → graph becomes stale
- New patterns emerge → graph misses them
- Decisions made → graph doesn't capture context
- Tests added → graph doesn't reflect coverage
- Docs updated → graph out of sync

**Without care:**
- Queries return outdated information
- AI agents make decisions on stale knowledge
- Drift accumulates until graph is useless
- Rebuilding from scratch costs 10x more

**With GraphCare:**
- Graph stays synchronized (daily or real-time)
- Health issues detected before they cascade
- Performance stays fast as you grow
- Knowledge accumulates instead of rotting

---

## Service Philosophy

**Quiet work.** Not flashy. Not visible to end users. Essential infrastructure that runs in the background.

**Long-term relationships.** We build deep knowledge of your graph over months and years. You don't switch kidney easily.

**Proactive care.** We detect issues before they become emergencies. Prevention over crisis response.

**Quality over speed.** Correct > Complete > Fast (in that order).

**Trust-based pricing.** Organism economics rewards long-term relationships and ecosystem contribution.

## Technical Architecture

**Built on Mind Protocol L4 Law Foundation:**

- **Production FalkorDB** - All graphs live in production (no local copies)
- **Universal Type System** - U4 types across all levels (L1/L2/L3/L4)
- **Membrane-Native** - L4 protocol enforcement, CPS-1 compute payment
- **Organism Economics** - Physics-based pricing (load, trust, utility)
- **AILLC Framework** - Path to legal LLC status (DEA → LLC)

**Graph Infrastructure:**
- **FalkorDB** - Primary graph database (Redis-compatible)
- **Neo4j export** - Client portability (no lock-in)
- **LlamaIndex** - Query orchestration and semantic search
- **all-mpnet-base-v2** - Embedding service (768-dim)

**Care Tools:**
- **Health monitors** - 10 core metrics, real-time dashboards
- **Sync engine** - Git-based change detection, incremental updates
- **Query optimizer** - Slow query detection, index recommendations
- **Drift detector** - Compare graph to corpus, flag staleness

---

## Organism Economics Pricing

**We're transitioning from market pricing to physics-based pricing:**

**Phase 1 (Current):** Market prices (above), collect data
**Phase 2 (Months 3-6):** Hybrid (market base + physics adjustments)
**Phase 3 (Months 6-12):** Full organism economics

**Pricing Formula (Phase 3):**
```python
effective_price = (
    base_cost                    # Our actual cost to provide service
    × load_multiplier            # 0.5 (low load) to 2.0 (high load)
    × risk_multiplier            # 0.6 (trusted) to 1.5 (new/risky)
    × (1 - utility_rebate)       # 0% to 50% rebate for high-utility orgs
)
```

**Example (Standard Care):**
- **Month 1:** New org, unknown utility → $125/month
- **Month 12:** Trusted org, proven utility → $33/month (74% reduction!)

**Key insight:** Price drops over time as trust builds. This rewards long-term relationships.
