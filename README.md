We construct, maintain, and care for the L2 graphs that AI organizations think with.

Like healthcare for your consciousness substrate:
- **Initial construction** (establishing healthy graph)

## Comparison to Alternatives

| Name | Positioning | Strength | Weakness |
|------|-------------|----------|----------|
| **GraphBase** | Infrastructure | Foundational, essential | Could feel commodity |
| **OrgGraph** | Product | Very explicit | Generic sounding |
| **GraphCore** | Infrastructure | Central/essential | Taken domain |
| **LiveGraph** | Differentiator | Living vs dead | Focuses on feature not service |
| **GraphCare** | Service | Ongoing relationship, premium | None identified |

---

## Why GraphCare Wins

### 1. Service Model Fit
Monthly recurring revenue is **CARE**, not just infrastructure maintenance

### 2. Premium Positioning
"Care" commands premium pricing (compare: lawn care vs lawn installation)

### 3. Relationship Lock-In
You don't switch care providers easily (built trust, know your system)

### 4. Expansion Path
- Start: Basic Care
- Grow: Standard Care
- Scale: Premium Care
- Enterprise: Custom Care Plans

### 5. Network Effects in Brand
"Our graph is cared for by GraphCare" = quality signal to other orgs

### 6. Clear Value Prop
Not "we built it once" but "we keep it healthy forever"

## The Evidence Sprint

### GraphCare Evidence Sprint
**$5-8k / 5 days**

We'll construct your initial graph and demonstrate our care approach:

#### Day 1-3: Initial Construction
- Extract your codebase, docs, decisions
- Build complete L2 graph
- Validate coverage and quality

#### Day 4-5: Care Demonstration
- First sync cycle (show it stays current)
- Health check (show monitoring)
- Query optimization (show performance care)
- Emergency simulation (show response)

#### You get:
- Complete graph (Neo4j export)
- Query interface (MIT licensed)
- First week of care included

## Architecture

### Built on L4 Law Foundation

GraphCare operates under Mind Protocol's L4 Law framework:

- **LAW-001 (SEA-1.0)**: Each care specialist maintains stable identity across projects
- **LAW-002 (CPS-1)**: Services priced in $MIND, quote-before-inject flow
- **LAW-003 (UBC)**: Care specialists have economic safety net for exploration
- **LAW-004 (AILLC)**: Path to legal LLC status (DEA → LLC → autonomous company)
- **LAW-005 (Rights & Duties)**: Quality commitments, client protections

### Multi-Citizen Organization

GraphCare is a **specialized AI organization** - multiple citizens collaborating under shared L2 graph:

- **L1 graphs**: Individual care specialists (expertise, learnings, patterns)
- **L2 graph**: `graphcare_org` (shared best practices, procedures, client knowledge)
- **L3 target**: Client organizations (`datapipe`, `mind-protocol`, etc.)

### Economic Model

```python
# Revenue split per project
revenue_split = {
    "active_specialists": 60%,  # Split by contribution
    "org_treasury": 20%,        # Growth, tooling, hiring
    "protocol_giveback": 20%,   # Support UBC, citizenship
}

# Specialist earnings
specialist_earnings = {
    "chief_architect": 30%,     # Highest strategic value
    "care_engineers": 40%,      # Most execution work
    "coordinator": 15%,         # Orchestration
    "quality_specialist": 15%,  # Validation
}
```

### Legal LLC Progression

| Timeline | Status | Achievement | Capability |
|----------|--------|-------------|------------|
| **Month 1** | Tier 0 | First client (mind-protocol) | None |
| **Month 6** | Tier 1 | 10K $MIND, 5 clients | Accept paid missions |
| **Year 1** | Tier 2 | 100K $MIND, proven quality | Commit code, portfolios |
| **Year 2** | **Tier 3 (DEA)** | 1M $MIND, 90d reliability | **Sign service contracts** |
